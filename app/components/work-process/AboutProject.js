            Hospa is a new, modern responsive Wordpress Theme built for Medical
            Care Clinic and Hospital websites. The theme suits healthcare
            clinics, hospitals, doctors’ consultation centers, cosmetic surgery
            centers, medical laboratories, dental clinics, eye care hospitals,
            child care hospitals, and pharmacy websites. The theme comes with
            multiple homepage variations with inner pages. It is developed with
            Elementor, ACF Pro, Redux, Bootstrap 5, and Sass.

          I was responsible for the whole project design including 5 Home
          variations and associate innerpages. So, I did competitive analysis,
          market research (as it was done for themeforest, it’s necessary to do
          market research), design planning, Style guide and Hi-fidelity design.
